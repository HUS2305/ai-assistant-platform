## Project Definition: Personal AI Assistant Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the development of a personal AI assistant platform that integrates deeply into WhatsApp and Telegram, with a connected web dashboard for management, customization, and analytics. The assistant understands text, voice, and image inputs and performs contextual actions across productivity and communication tools.

The goal is to create a single conversational interface where users can manage their schedules, reminders, emails, and content through natural chat interactions, while the dashboard provides structure, visibility, and control.

## Core Capabilities

1. Multimodal Understanding

   - Interpret and act upon text, voice (Whisper), and images (Vision).
   - Support natural communication in any format.

2. Personal Productivity and Scheduling

   - Calendar integration (create, modify, summarize events)
   - Notes and reminders (manual and proactive)
   - Daily summaries and “friend-style” reminders
   - Learns user habits (preferred times, tone, and meeting styles)

3. Persistent Memory

   - Store user preferences, tone, and recurring actions
   - Provide contextual continuity between interactions

4. Web Dashboard

   - Visual control layer for reminders, notes, and integrations
   - Suite-specific modules for analytics and workflow
   - Synchronization with assistant conversations

## Product Structure

The platform consists of a core assistant layer and specialized suites.

### Core Assistant

Includes:

- OpenAI GPT (reasoning and generation)
- Whisper (speech-to-text)
- Vision (image understanding)
- WhatsApp Cloud API and Telegram Bot API
- Google Calendar API
- Persistent user memory with Postgres and Prisma
- Auth, billing, and integration with dashboard

### Creator Suite

For creators and small brands managing social content.

Features:

- Content calendar and auto-post scheduling
- Caption and hashtag generation
- Performance analytics and image-based suggestions
- Chat-based commands for post management

### Email Management Suite

For professionals handling high email volume.

Features:

- Gmail and Outlook integration
- AI-generated draft replies
- Thread summarization and organization
- Follow-up reminders and inbox labeling
- Calendar linkage for meetings

## Long-Term Vision

To evolve into a modular AI workspace with domain-specific assistants sharing the same infrastructure. Future suites could include Real Estate, Agency, or General Productivity Suites.

## Strategic Positioning

This platform combines:

- A chat-first interface in WhatsApp and Telegram
- Multimodal AI (text, voice, and image)
- Persistent user memory and context awareness
- Modular suite-based expansion
- A dashboard for structure and transparency

## Mission

To create a personal and professional AI assistant that understands users naturally, acts across their tools, and centralizes their daily digital life into one seamless, chat-based experience.

## Tech Stack Decisions

- Frontend uses Next.js 14 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS, shared UI package, and Vitest.
- Backend API uses Fastify with tRPC, Prisma for Postgres, and BullMQ on Redis for background jobs.
- Authentication is powered by NextAuth, backed by Prisma + Postgres.
- AI integrations rely on OpenAI (GPT, Whisper, Vision) behind typed wrappers to allow future provider swaps.
- Messaging integrations use WhatsApp Cloud API and Telegram Bot API directly (no third-party aggregators).

## Customer Billing and Onboarding Flow

1. Prospects are sent to Stripe Checkout first; successful payment creates/updates the customer in our system via Stripe webhooks.
2. After checkout we trigger an onboarding sequence (email link or redirect) that walks the user through profile setup and connects messaging channels.
3. NextAuth handles account authentication; onboarding completion marks the workspace as active and unlocks the dashboard.

## Rules for Cursor

- Always show full file paths and complete code when creating or editing files.
- Maintain consistent folder structure across /api, /web, /core, and /suites.
- Use environment variables for all API keys.
- Adhere to modular principles: isolate suite logic from core assistant logic.
- Prioritize clear, maintainable TypeScript and Next.js structure.
- Ensure integrations (OpenAI, Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.) use typed wrappers.
